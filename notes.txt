Node.js C++ Addons

One of the most under appreciated features in Node is it's ability to wrap legacy C/C++ code.
In this meetup I will explain where to start, how to do a simple "Hello world", and show other examples to get your brains ticking and thinking about making fast code even faster! 


One of Node's most powerful features is its ability to wrap calls to C/C++ code. 
This means you can wrap existing legacy code or write super fast functions to process data.
The possibilities are endless!

In this talk we will cover a simple hello world example, 
discuss future-proofing code with NaN (Native Abstractions for Node),
cover build processes with node-gyp,
then move onto passing data around via objects and arrays,
and finally wrap a call to the OpenCV C++ library.
